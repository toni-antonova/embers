1. Please create a header toggle in the tracking_work_history.md file with the title that I spelled out in [content] after /milestone command. 

2. Write a small description of what is included in this milestone. Use your best understanding of the title and also what is in the git diff. 

3. Refresh the website and take a small video of you interacting with it. Save the video and put an HTML block in the tracking work history doc under that milestone header toggle. 

4. Do the same with a couple of screenshots. Save the files somewhere, and put them in the toggle milestone in tracking work history doc. 

5. Put any notes about this milestone that you think are significant to remember. Decisions made or otherwise.  

This is different than the rest of the tracking_work_history.md, which we should proceed updating and saving as usual. Don't replace exisitng content in this document, only add new content.
